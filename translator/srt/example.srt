1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,033
cheat that he sent me

2
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:02,600
and it's got a list of a ton of things

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,000
can I just read off and ask questions

210
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,900
I think 30 million dollars a year in revenue

211
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,600
just off shopify apps

212
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,533
the Shopify ecosystem was interesting

213
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,466
I mean it's interesting

214
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,033
if you can create something really easily

215
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:36,866
and other people can copy you really easily

216
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:40,033
and then you don't control the payments

217
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,800
it's it was a whole wild experience in there

218
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,033
because shopify controls all the money

219
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:45,066
you don't you have to wait for your

220
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:47,100
your grandpa to give you your nickels

221
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,066
and they control the whole the whole thing

222
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:51,000
so we're like let's get the hell out of this world

223
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,133
but yeah we commerce looks like

224
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,100
535 Canadian which is what like 100 million American

225
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,233
no not that bad

226
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,100
yeah

227
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,266
like what's the conversion of monopoly money to USD
