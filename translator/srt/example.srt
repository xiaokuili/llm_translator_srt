1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,033
cheat that he sent me

2
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:02,600
and it's got a list of a ton of things

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,000
can I just read off and ask questions

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,100
I actually want to ask you about Chrome extensions

5
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:08,133
because they're like

6
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,100
I'm like nerding out on Chrome extensions right now

7
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,266
have you ever even made one

8
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:14,933
I've bought one so we have one right now you have one

9
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,000
so on here so I tweeted out

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,666
so this is a mutual friend of ours by the way

11
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:20,866
but I can't say who it is

12
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:23,200
they were considering buying a company

13
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,500
and it was a Chrome extension

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
and it was two people

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,933
who were doing 25 million dollars a year in sales

16
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:31,200
with their Chrome extension

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,733
it's pretty crazy and then Grammarly you know Grammarly

18
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,833
yeah Grammarly I think is like a 20

19
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:39,866
billion dollar company at this point

20
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,033
Grammarly does like 80 million in revenue

21
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:45,200
that is what I like

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
these sleeper ones that people kind of just like

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,066
don't really grammatically is the best man

24
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,833
it started by this guy named Max who's

25
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,333
I think he's from like the Ukraine

26
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,000
and he's a lives in Canada

27
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,100
and he's a he's a hardcore engineer

28
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:59,133
and I asked him at Hustle Con the backstage

29
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,500
like that they had not they bootstrapped it

30
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,033
and they raised a funding

31
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,333
they raised $100 million at a billion dollar valuation

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,533
and I was with them backstage and I was like

33
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:09,433
dude that's amazing

34
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:11,633
so you're like almost a billionaire now he goes yeah

35
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:12,333
it's pretty cool

36
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,600
like the business is way bigger than than than no

37
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,666
and he like he like smirk but he was real low key

38
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,033
he's like yeah it's cool

39
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:20,000
the business is way bigger than most people realize

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,266
like it's gonna be huge

41
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:22,600
and it was awesome

42
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,866
so Grammarly's a good business

43
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,466
what what's your Chrome extension

44
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:28,266
Leo Io what's it do

45
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:30,266
so it's kind of similar to that momentum one

46
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:31,266
which I think is pretty popular

47
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:33,033
it's the main one when you open up a tab

48
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:34,333
it has like a nice background

49
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:35,100
I think that

50
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,600
taking a step back on these Chrome extensions

51
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,666
I think what's interesting

52
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,033
about your tweet

53
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,500
which was like this Chromecast make 25 million

54
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,200
or these is what are things that not everyone else

55
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,066
is paying attention to

56
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:48,233
that you can acquire for not a market rate

57
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,300
like I think ultimately

58
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,700
that's how you can have a lot of success in business

59
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,800
but that's specifically for for marketing

60
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,033
a lot of what I look for

61
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,700
so when we launched Sumo

62
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,233
Com I actually bought

63
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,066
probably about

64
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,300
5 million installs

65
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,500
I think

66
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,700
give or take 5 million installs of WordPress plugins

67
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:02,733
so I bought like

68
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:05,066
some of the most popular WordPress plugins around

69
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,266
no way which ones

70
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,866
I mean I have to pull up our list now

71
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,866
but the biggest one was Google Analytics

72
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,033
so it was like a million person install yeah

73
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,400
so it's Google Analytica

74
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,933
we bought WP Fonts we bought

75
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,133
Construction Page so basically I

76
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,733
used a bunch of those

77
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,266
yeah so we scraped the

78
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,333
the thing that it's not just copying this because

79
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,000
now people are more aware of it

80
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,233
but what you're looking for is like

81
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,533
one can you get structured data

82
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:32,833
so we went to the WordPress directory

83
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,400
and you could get all their rankings

84
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,900
so I got all the rankings and then I sorted it by

85
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,033
ones that were not updated recently

86
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,533
so I said which ones had the most installs

87
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:41,866
that no one's taken care of

88
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:43,600
and I would just email them and say hey

89
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,833
you haven't taken care of it

90
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:45,933
I'll pay you for it

91
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,666
and because there's not a market for it

92
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,066
you can get a cheaper price

93
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:50,500
and then I just sent a blast

94
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,800
email to a lot of these people

95
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:52,900
and picked up millions of installs

96
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,800
and that drove a significant amount of Sumo

97
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:54,933
Com

98
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:57,333
did you even pay more than six figures for any of them

99
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:00,233
for the Google Analytics one they had a million souls

100
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:02,300
I paid 100 k wow that's crazy isn't it

101
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,500
that was the most expensive one

102
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,866
I could pull up my price

103
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:06,433
could that could that Google

104
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,000
so for the people listening WordPress

105
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,733
if you don't use WordPress

106
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:10,933
I mean WordPress is used by like

107
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,000
three fourths of the internet

108
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,933
or half of half of like the top

109
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:15,300
10,000 websites

110
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,733
and they have this like crazy

111
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,700
database of all types of apps that you could plug

112
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,066
user or plugins

113
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:26,900
it's amazing and sumo was a email capture plugin

114
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,333
yeah man I found our list

115
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,800
we had a lot of I bought all of one favicon

116
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:33,466
just a bunch of random ones

117
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,333
and then we would rebrand them and then cross promote

118
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,233
assume calm within WordPress

119
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:40,100
and I was thinking I would do the same

120
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,100
and the thing was is there's not like

121
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:44,900
these websites where people are buying and selling them

122
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,200
and a lot of these guys weren't monetizing

123
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,300
it was just hobbies

124
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,533
and so I think in marketing and business

125
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,233
you got to look for something

126
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,333
that's a problem that other people haven't identified

127
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,900
and that's also why I bought the Chrome extension

128
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,533
I bought it for I think 25

129
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,700
I bought it for 25 thousand for 40 thousand installs

130
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:01,200
active installs on Chrome

131
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,100
but with that one we could not monetize it at all

132
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:06,666
we tried like paid features we tried ads to it

133
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,800
we tried to grow it

134
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,133
and we were not as successful

135
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:11,233
so pretty much lost almost all the money on that one

136
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:11,400
how much

137
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,066
what's the CPM on ads for Chrome plugin do you know

138
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,233
I don't remember what it was but it was abysmal

139
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,733
and it wasn't something that we were able to grow

140
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:22,000
dramatically like I thought we could

141
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,700
like the WordPress stuff was really cheap

142
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,266
like we were getting that stuff super cheap back in the

143
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,833
that's crazy there's this guy

144
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,833
like I think there's this guy who

145
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,433
I bet you know who you definitely know

146
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:31,333
I think his name Sai what's the same Sai

147
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:33,266
his last name starts with the B

148
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,433
side by side

149
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:38,066
and he owns this thing called awesome what's it called

150
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,900
it's called Awesome Corp or something

151
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,333
he owns WP Beginner

152
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,500
he's like the WordPress underground Mafia

153
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,866
he owns a lot of WordPress blogs

154
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,000
and let me explain the story

155
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,433
the story that I know it as

156
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:50,466
so basically he's only he's young

157
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:52,833
he's I think he's from Pakistan and he's only like

158
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,500
28 or something or 29

159
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,900
and he started this thing called WP Beginner

160
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,400
which is a WordPress

161
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,733
a site on WordPress

162
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,466
so if you like how to install blank on WordPress

163
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:03,666
he'll show up number one

164
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,466
it gets like 5 or 10 million unique a month

165
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:08,200
a ton a ton of unique a month

166
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,000
and using his blogs

167
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,500
he would see which plugins would get the most install

168
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,133
so he would say like here are all the best like

169
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:18,600
forms for WordPress or here's all the best like font

170
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,300
plugins for WordPress

171
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,800
and he would just see which are the best

172
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,533
he would buy the best ones

173
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:25,100
and then just promote them extra hard on WP beginner

174
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,266
and at this point

175
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,433
I bet you he makes 50 million dollars a year

176
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:29,866
on all of his WordPress stuff

177
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:32,466
wouldn't be surprised

178
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,866
I mean I love these industries that like

179
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,133
everyone's sleeping on

180
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:37,733
like I think that WordPress stuff is really interesting

181
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,266
it probably is still a decent category

182
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,466
what's fascinating though is the other side of the Sam

183
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:41,700
so

184
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,500
I actually try to do the same strategy in Shopify apps

185
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:47,333
so I went over to Shopify and we were launching Sumo

186
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,800
Com on Shopify and I was like man

187
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,700
I'll just go buy all these people over there

188
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,300
what was interesting was that

189
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
a lot of the people on Shopify

190
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,300
were a little bit more savvy

191
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,633
and they had recurring revenue

192
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,900
so they were like we want 10x the price

193
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,300
where like 10x the price of their revenue

194
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,200
where the WordPress plugins

195
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,300
they weren't really making money

196
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,500
so I was like hey I'll pay 1

197
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,033
cent for every active install you have

198
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:07,133
so I was getting them for very very cheap

199
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:08,600
but the Shopify

200
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,200
ones like I couldn't

201
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,133
I literally couldn't buy almost anything

202
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,200
so our friend Andrew Wilkinson

203
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,433
bought a couple of them

204
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:16,133
and he rolled them up and eventually took it public

205
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,466
and it currently it's in

206
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,800
it's public on the Canadian stock exchange right now

207
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,633
probably for 600 million dollar market cap

208
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:23,300
it's called Wii Commerce

209
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,800
and they do like

210
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,900
I think 30 million dollars a year in revenue

211
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,600
just off shopify apps

212
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,533
the Shopify ecosystem was interesting

213
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,466
I mean it's interesting

214
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,033
if you can create something really easily

215
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:36,866
and other people can copy you really easily

216
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:40,033
and then you don't control the payments

217
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,800
it's it was a whole wild experience in there

218
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,033
because shopify controls all the money

219
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:45,066
you don't you have to wait for your

220
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:47,100
your grandpa to give you your nickels

221
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,066
and they control the whole the whole thing

222
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:51,000
so we're like let's get the hell out of this world

223
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,133
but yeah we commerce looks like

224
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,100
535 Canadian which is what like 100 million American

225
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,233
no not that bad

226
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,100
yeah

227
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,266
like what's the conversion of monopoly money to USD
